Metal-Examples
==============

Just some examples of using the Metal API. This is mostly just for me while I familiarize myself with the API. So is unlikely to be of interest to anyone.


To set it up, simply create a single view project (and have its view controller simply called ViewController, with a single UIView), and add the code from a specific example to build it.
